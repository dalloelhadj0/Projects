Do you have test functions testing all your functions? Have you tested
edge cases susch as first element in an arrya, last element in an
array, empty array, etc?

complete and correct programs:  50/ 50


Does your program compile without warnings? Are there any blocks of
repeated code that can be simplified?

good programming practices:     30/ 30

Do you have comments for each class both in the header and
implementation file? Does each variable and function have an
associated comment? Is your program properly indented? See "Code Style
Examples - Snippets" under C++ Resources for some common problems. For
example, all file names have to be in lowercase, all class names are
capitalized, need to have spaces after comments, stick to maximum 80
characters per line, space between operators, etc.

code that is easy to understand:     20/ 20
